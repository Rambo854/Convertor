//Purpose ----------------------------------------------
//This is my convertor, it performs two main functions.
//Converting measurements that are entered in from centimeters to Inches.
//Converting measuremenst that are enetered in from Meters to Feet.
//from the single screen, you can either use one of the main functions or
//exit the program completely. I assigned switch with cases to each of these.
//Case 1 for cm to inches, case 2 for m to feet, and finally case 3 for exiting
//the program.
